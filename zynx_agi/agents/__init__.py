# Placeholder for Zynx Agents core components
# This package will contain the building blocks for creating and managing AI Agents
# within the Zynx Ecosystem, as described by the @zynx/agents SDK component.

# Conceptual components:
# - AgentDefinition: Base class or Pydantic model for defining an agent's properties.
# - AgentRegistry: For discovering and managing available agents.
# - Skill: Base class or interface for agent capabilities.
# - Trigger: Defines how an agent is activated.
# - MemoryComponent: APIs for short-term and long-term memory.
# - AgentInteractionClient: For agents to call other agents.

# These will be further developed to support the TypeScript-defined agents
# by providing the necessary backend infrastructure and APIs.

# Example:
# from .agent_registry import AgentRegistry
# from .memory import MemoryComponent

# registry = AgentRegistry()
# memory_manager = MemoryComponent()
